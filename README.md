# ImageSteganography

## Overview

The Image Steganography Project is a secure communication tool that enables users to conceal messages within digital images. This innovative project combines advanced encoding algorithms with a user-friendly interface, allowing for covert data exchange while maintaining the visual integrity of the images.

## Key Features

- **Secure Communication:** Encode and decode messages within images for confidential information exchange.
- **Visual Imperceptibility:** Concealed messages are visually imperceptible, preserving the original appearance of the images.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for easy image selection, message input, and encoding/decoding operations.
- **Advanced Encryption:** Utilizes sophisticated encryption techniques to resist common steganalysis methods.

## Usage

1. **Encode Message:**
   - Select an image.
   - Input the message for encoding.
   - Click on the "Encode" button.

2. **Decode Message:**
   - Select the encoded image.
   - Click on the "Decode" button.
